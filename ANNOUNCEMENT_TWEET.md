**Title:** [Project] CertiKAS - Blockchain Content Certification to Combat Fake News

**Body:**
```
Hey Kaspa community! 👋

I've just launched **CertiKAS**, an open-source platform that uses Kaspa blockchain to certify content authenticity and fight AI-generated fake news.

**The Problem:**
Remember that discussion about browser-integrated verification? As AI gets better, we can't tell real from fake anymore. We need blockchain's immutability.

**The Solution:**
CertiKAS lets content creators certify their work on Kaspa blockchain:
- Immutable proof of authorship
- Timestamped certificates
- Public verification
- Fast & cheap (thanks to Kaspa!)
- Browser extension (in development)

**Why Kaspa?**
- ⚡ Fast confirmations (<10 sec)
- 💰 Ultra-low fees
- 🔒 Secure PoW consensus
- 🌐 Decentralized & censorship-resistant

**Current Status:**
- ✅ Core platform complete (2,200+ lines of code)
- ✅ REST API with 15 endpoints
- ✅ Web dashboard
- ✅ Comprehensive documentation
- 🚧 Browser extension (Q1 2026)
- 🚧 Igra token integration (when launched)

**Tech Stack:**
Node.js, Express, Kaspa WASM SDK, Kasplex (prepared), hexagonal architecture

**GitHub:** https://github.com/ErwanHenry/CertiKAS

**Looking for:**
- Beta testers
- Frontend devs (browser extension)
- Feedback from journalists/content creators
- Kaspa node recommendations

Let me know what you think! Questions welcome. 🚀

**Title:** [Project Launch] Fighting Fake News with Blockchain - CertiKAS on Kaspa

**Body:**
```
With AI-generated content becoming indistinguishable from reality, I built a blockchain-based solution to verify content authenticity.

**CertiKAS** uses Kaspa blockchain to provide immutable certification for articles, videos, images, and documents.

**Key Features:**
- Certify content with cryptographic proof
- Public verification via API or web interface
- Browser extension to flag uncertified content
- Token rewards for verified creators (Igra integration planned)
- Open-source & transparent

**Why Blockchain?**
Traditional verification (watermarks, signatures) can be faked. Blockchain provides:
- Immutable records
- Decentralized trust
- Transparent verification
- Censorship resistance

**Why Kaspa?**
- Fast confirmations (~10 sec vs Bitcoin's ~10 min)
- Low fees (~$0.0001 per certification)
- Secure Proof-of-Work
- Growing ecosystem

**Real-World Use Cases:**
- Journalists proving original reporting
- Content creators protecting IP
- Researchers verifying data sources
- News orgs building trust
- Citizens identifying fake news

**Current Status:**
Production-ready MVP with API, web dashboard, and docs. Browser extension in development.

## Hacker News Post

**Title:** CertiKAS: Blockchain-based content certification on Kaspa to fight fake news

**URL:** https://github.com/ErwanHenry/CertiKAS

**Body:**
```
Hey HN! I built CertiKAS to address the growing problem of AI-generated fake content.

**The Problem:**
As AI gets better at generating realistic text, images, and videos, we're losing the ability to distinguish real from fake. Watermarks can be removed, signatures can be forged.

**The Solution:**
Use blockchain's immutability to create tamper-proof certificates of authenticity. Content creators certify their work on Kaspa blockchain, anyone can verify it.

**Why Kaspa?**
- Fast (~10 second confirmations vs Bitcoin's ~10 minutes)
- Cheap (~$0.0001 per certification vs Ethereum's gas fees)
- Decentralized & secure (Proof-of-Work)

**Architecture:**
- Hexagonal (ports & adapters) for clean separation
- REST API for easy integration
- Kasplex smart contracts (for token rewards)
- Browser extension (in development)

**Current Status:**
Production-ready MVP. 2,200+ lines of backend code, comprehensive docs, working API.

**Challenges:**
- User adoption (chicken-and-egg problem)
- Integration with existing platforms
- Vercel deployment issues (serverless + ES6 modules)

Would love feedback, especially on:
1. Business model (API subscriptions? News org partnerships?)
2. Browser extension UX
3. Scaling strategy
